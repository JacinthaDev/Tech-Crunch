# My Awesome Project
This is my mock-up version of the Tech Crunch website. I flexed my knowledge of CSS and layout to create this project.

Link to project: https://techcrunch-rc.netlify.app

## How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS

I dove deep into my understanding of CSS layouts and used floats to design the finished product.

## Lessons Learned:
By the time I made this mockup, I had already completed 5 similar projects practicing CSS layout. During the creation of this site, I became more adept at detecting my mistakes and solidifying my knowledge of the rules and restrictions of different CSS properties.

### Examples:
Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:
